                    <p>Welcome to my website! </p>

                    <p> Today we are tinkering around with HTML and css to understand how
                        to use flexbox and grid layout. We are also learning how to make websites 
                    responsive and how to use media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
                    i need to have a Navigation bar that is responsive and works well on mobile devices.
                    i should also have proper alignment and spacing between elements to make the website look clean and organized.
